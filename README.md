# Lab - Simple Bootstrap 

You'll probably spend most of your web development life using templates developed by designers who spent significant time developing those templates.

But as you modify their work, it will be useful to have built a simple Bootstrap page yourself.

Create a new file in your Cloud9 workspace; name it *simple_bootstrap.html*.

Navigate to (http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp), copy the example to get started, then add a Jumbotron element with your name.

Save, add and commit the file.
